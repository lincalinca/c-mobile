## Ten Paragraph Description
*For business stakeholders and detailed explanations*

### The Problem

Musicians accumulate receipts constantly—from instrument purchases and gear upgrades to repair services, weekly lessons, and concert tickets. These paper trails are essential for warranty claims, insurance documentation, tax deductions, and simply knowing what you own. Yet most musicians resort to shoeboxes, scattered photos, or spreadsheets that quickly become outdated. The manual effort of entering receipt data is tedious enough that it rarely happens consistently, leaving valuable information lost or disorganized.

### The Solution

Crescender is an AI-powered mobile application that transforms receipt management for musicians. Users simply photograph any music-related receipt, and the app's artificial intelligence extracts structured data automatically—merchant details, line items, prices, dates, and category-specific metadata. What would take minutes of manual entry happens in seconds, with accuracy that improves as the AI learns from corrections.

### Intelligent Categorization

The app automatically classifies every line item into one of five categories: Gear (instruments and equipment), Service (repairs and maintenance), Education (lessons and instruction), Events (concerts and performances), and Other (general items). Each category captures specialized metadata—gear items track brand, model, serial number, and condition; education items capture teacher name, student, lesson frequency, and schedule; service items link to the original gear purchase and track warranty status.

### Streamlined Review Workflow

After AI processing, users review the extracted data through an intuitive workflow. Simple single-item receipts get a streamlined one-screen confirmation. Complex receipts with multiple items guide users through a step-by-step process, highlighting any missing critical information (like a student name for a lesson receipt) and making it easy to correct or enhance the AI's work. This balance of automation and human oversight ensures data quality without creating friction.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Unlike many modern apps, Crescender requires no account creation and stores all data locally on the user's device. Receipt images are processed through secure cloud functions but are not retained. No personal information is collected or sold. Users maintain complete ownership and control of their data, which is particularly important for financial records. This privacy-centric approach builds trust and removes barriers to adoption.

### Sustainable Monetization

The app provides 10 free receipt scans to every user, enough to experience the full value proposition. Additional scans can be earned by watching short advertisements—10 bonus scans per ad viewed. This model keeps the app accessible to casual users while generating revenue without compromising user privacy or requiring subscription commitments. The ad integration uses Google AdMob with full App Tracking Transparency compliance on iOS.

### Powerful Organization Tools

Beyond scanning, Crescender serves as a comprehensive music expense database. Users can browse their complete history with filters for category, date range (including preset financial year options for tax preparation), and merchant. The card-based interface provides quick overviews with expandable details. Search functionality helps locate specific purchases instantly, whether you need the serial number of a guitar bought three years ago or want to review all lessons with a particular teacher.

### Calendar Integration

Music lessons and service appointments don't exist in isolation—they need to appear in your schedule. Crescender integrates with the device's native calendar, allowing users to export education and service events with a single tap. For recurring lessons, the app creates the full series of calendar events with appropriate notifications. This bridges the gap between expense tracking and day-to-day time management.

### Target Market

Crescender serves a well-defined niche: musicians of all levels who want better financial organization. This includes hobbyists building their first gear collection, parents tracking children's music education expenses, teachers managing their business, gigging musicians with deductible equipment costs, and serious collectors who need detailed inventory records. The music retail and education market represents billions in annual spending, yet lacks purpose-built tracking tools.

### Technical Foundation

The app is built on modern, proven technologies: React Native and Expo for cross-platform iOS/Android deployment, TypeScript for code reliability, and a local SQLite database with Drizzle ORM for robust data management. The AI processing leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model through Supabase Edge Functions, providing state-of-the-art image understanding while keeping the mobile app lightweight. This architecture enables rapid feature development while maintaining performance and reliability across devices.
